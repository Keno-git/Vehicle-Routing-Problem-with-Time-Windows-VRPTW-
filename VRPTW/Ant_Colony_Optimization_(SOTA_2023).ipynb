        "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithm that has been introduced as an approach to solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as routing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may be already familiar with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the goal is to find the shortest path traversing all nodes on a given graph. A generalization of the TSP is the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP - or Truck Dispatching Problem as first introduced [1]) where the goal is to find the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "ACO is inspired by the ants' foraging behaviour. Each ant (leaving the nest) performs a search towards a random direction until it finds a food source. Then, it returns to the nest. The path leading to the food source is \"marked\", because the ant leaves behind a trace of pheromone while exploring. The pheromone can be detected by other ants. Thus, it is more possible for other ants starting their search to follow this \"marked\" path, since the pheromone is indicating a food source exists in that direction. Every new ant following this path applies an additional layer of pheromone on it. As a result, the more ants traversing the path the more pheromone is applied to it. On the other hand, if no food source has been found the pheromone scent is decreased because pheromone is gradually evaporated.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the algorithmic equivalent, every agent (or candidate solution) is an ant performing a search in the solution space. The \"paths\" created by the agent denote a sequence of nodes. Below, you can see the application of the ACO concept on the simplest routing problem, i.e., the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n",
